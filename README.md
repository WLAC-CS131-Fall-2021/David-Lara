My CS131 Presentation on Sobel Edge Detection and Matrices. I have included an image in the repository to use for my program if you so desire to use it with that image. Otherwise, you can enter the directory of an image into the program and it should create an image that has had the sobel operator applied to it. The image should be stored in the same location where you ran the java program.
